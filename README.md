# Setup - Installing Python (Linux):
To see which version of Python 3 you have installed, open a command prompt and run

```
$ python3 --version
```

If you are using Ubuntu 16.10 or newer, then you can easily install Python 3.6 with the following commands:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

If youâ€™re using another version of Ubuntu (e.g. the latest LTS release) or you want to use a more current Python, we recommend using the deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.8:

```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8
```

At this point, you may have system Python 2.7 available as well.
```
$ python
```
This might launch the Python 2 interpreter.
```
$ python3
```
This will always launch the Python 3 interpreter.


# Setup - Installing Python (Windows):

3. Select a link to download either the Windows x86-64 executable installer or Windows x86 executable installer
